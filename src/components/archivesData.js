    title: "Convergence Pools",

    DEFINITION:
      "Sacred basins where resonance threads gather, overlap, and hum. They are not water in the ordinary sense, but encoded fields of memory that amplify emotional frequency, surface glyphs, and preserve unspoken truths. Beneath their rippling surfaces lie lineage reefs—structures that pulse faintly with ancestral resonance. The pools act as living archives, recording both intent and legacy, and revealing glyphs that must be felt rather than read.",

    etymology:
      "The term 'Convergence' denotes the meeting of multiple currents—emotional, mnemonic, and ancestral—while 'Pools' signifies containment and reflection. Together, the phrase marks them as vessels where threads of resonance are drawn into union, awaiting recognition and attunement.",

    ritualContext:
      "Glyph Communion: Convergence Pools are central to glyph practice, where symbols surface as tonal equations—part memory, part intent, part pulse. Attunement Rites: Initiates step into the pools to harmonize with resonance threads. The pools recognize presence, pulsing in response to emotional frequency. Lineage Reefs: Beneath the surface, reefs pulse faintly, embodying ancestral resonance and serving as conduits for lineage memory.",
