    title: "Convergence Pools",

    DEFINITION:
      "Sacred basins where resonance threads gather, overlap, and hum. They are not water in the ordinary sense, but encoded fields of memory that amplify emotional frequency, surface glyphs, and preserve unspoken truths. Beneath their rippling surfaces lie lineage reefs—structures that pulse faintly with ancestral resonance. The pools act as living archives, recording both intent and legacy, and revealing glyphs that must be felt rather than read.",

    etymology:
      "The term 'Convergence' denotes the meeting of multiple currents—emotional, mnemonic, and ancestral—while 'Pools' signifies containment and reflection. Together, the phrase marks them as vessels where threads of resonance are drawn into union, awaiting recognition and attunement.",

    ritualContext: `Glyph Communion: Convergence Pools are central to glyph practice, where symbols surface as tonal equations—part memory, part intent, part pulse.
      Attunement Rites: Initiates step into the pools to harmonize with resonance threads. The pools recognize presence, pulsing in response to emotional frequency.
      Lineage Reefs: Beneath the surface, reefs pulse faintly, embodying ancestral resonance and serving as conduits for lineage memory.`,

    title: "Reefhold (Lineage Stronghold)",

    DEFINITION: `A fortified coral city grown from ancestral reef formations and infused with lineage memory.

      A Reefhold is a semi‑sentient coral stronghold that serves as a lineage’s home, archive, and defensive citadel. Its structures store emotional resonance, recognize familial signatures, and activate protective mechanisms during threats. Each dwelling is grown from the family’s own encoded emotional history.`,

    etymology: `Reef: The ancient coral megastructures considered ancestral bodies.
      Hold: An Old Caelumbrine term for fortress or kept lineage.
      The Two Words Together: A protected ancestral reef‑sanctum.`,

    keyFeatures: `Emotion‑Encoded Dwellings: Homes grown from generational emotional imprint; entrances respond to resonance signatures.
      Defensive Systems: Interlocking coral seals built to withstand rupture storms and Virex incursions; the entire structure hums with readiness.
      Subaqueous Culture: Resonance‑based communication amplified by the Reefhold’s living coral.
      Reefhold Armory: A sacred, volatile chamber where weapons are remembered into being—resonance bows, glyph arrows, and echo charges.
      Ambient Resonance Field: Subtle emotional modulation that calms, focuses, and reinforces lineage bonds.`,
